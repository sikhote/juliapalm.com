# Dr. Julia Sinclair-Palm

Her research on trans youth carries the trace of this interdisciplinary history—across her work, she considers how conceptualizations of trans youth are tied to concerns about violence, risk, and mental health often at the exclusion of other, more complex narratives of identity, gender, and belonging. She examines how trans youth forge new identities, imagine futures and navigate structural inequalities in the midst of these larger, and sometimes restrictive narratives about trans lives.
